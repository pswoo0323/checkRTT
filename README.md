# Comepare of RTT from my destop to major CSP
Generally, cloud platforms are chosen in the order of AWS, Azure, and GCP, as they are widely used and well-validated. However, there are questions about whether this selection criterion is always the best. The need for selection criteria based on actual performance data is being emphasized.
I started my research because I was curious about the network latency from my desktop to major cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and Ncloud.

# Enviornment
os: Window11
Network: 1Gbps Cable
tool:Pyton3.8

# Result
I collected the data for 7days.
